          Hi! I'm Vansh, a passionate and dedicated individual currently pursuing a
          Bachelor of Computer Science with a specialization in Data Science and AI
          at Monash University. I have a keen interest in cybersecurity and aspire to eventually
          launch my own tech company. My academic journey has been shaped by my strong foundation
          in Mathematics, Physics, and Computer Science, which I developed during my schooling years in India.
        </p>
        <p>
          Beyond my studies, I enjoy engaging in sports, particularly cricket, where I’ve
          achieved recognition as a state-level player. In addition, I have earned multiple
          gold medals in international Olympiads, showcasing my drive for excellence and
          problem-solving skills.
        </p>
        <p>
         I'm currently immersing myself in coding through various platforms like Udemy, where I’m working through the 100 Days of Code challenge to deepen my understanding of Python. I also have experience in Java, and I’m keen on exploring more advanced topics within Data Science, Artificial Intelligence, and Cybersecurity.

When I’m not studying or coding, I enjoy spending time in the gym and focusing on my health. I’m always looking for opportunities to grow and take on challenges, whether it’s through my academic work or personal projects.
